<div class="post-header">... without realizing it.</div>

<div dir="ltr"><br />I recall a humorous instance when one of my Popperian friends in London chastised me for moving to Hackney. "Don't you realize how high the crime rate is there?"<br /><br />"[INSERT NAME HERE]," I replied, "you're not suggesting that, because the crime rate was high there until today, it will continue to be high there tomorrow, are you? Because that sounds a lot like an inductive inference."<br /><br />Of course, no one could make it through the day without making continual inductive inferences, so of course Popperians make them all of the time... even when trying to refute the idea that inductive inference is necessary. Take Lee Kelly, <a href="http://increasingmu.wordpress.com/2012/05/04/guest-post-lee-kelly-on-callahan-on-popper/">responding to my previous post on Popper</a>:<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">(1) A theory which is falsified by some observation-statement today is still falsified by it tomorrow, next week, a month later, and forever after. This is not induction. The falsifying relation is deductive and timeless&ndash;to say that it will continue to hold in the future is to be merely logically consistent.<br /><br />A mathematician is not inducing when he concludes that &lsquo;1 + 1 = 2&rsquo;, which is true today, will continue to be true tomorrow. If there is no pretense of having derived the future from the past, then there is no attempted induction. The mathematician concludes that &lsquo;1 + 1 = 2&rsquo; will continue to be true tomorrow because its negation is inconsistent&ndash;a deductive inference.<br /><br />The falsifying relations between statements are analogous to the above equation. If a theory is falsified by some statement today, then it will continue to be falsified by it tomorrow.</blockquote>
Kelly muddies the water here, because the issue of induction is only of concern for empirical theories, but he presents us with a deductive theory in his example. Of course, if I am trying to prove a timeless, mathematical truth, and it is false at any point in time, that means it is false forever. But things are very different with empirical theories. They are true if they describe reality accurately, and false if they do not.<br /><br />So, consider the theory, "On earth, feathered, flying bipeds evolved from dinosaurs." If this theory was put forward by an alien scientist visiting earth 200 million years ago, it would be false. No such thing had happened. But if we put it forward today, it is true. On a simpler level, let us imagine that, in 2008, I said, "The US has combat troops in Iraq." Can Kelly come forward now, and say, "Well, I checked that today, and the US doesn't have such troops in Iraq: and so, since a statement falsified by an observation today is falsified by it for all time, your theory was wrong."<br /><br />Thus, it should be obvious that an empirical theory can be false if put forward at time T, but become true at some other point T + x. "Ah," but Kelly may respond, "but you are talking about historically contingent theories now, and that's cheating. You know I meant things like the laws of physics, which we expect to hold at all times."<br /><br />And this point is very telling. When Newton put forward his theory of gravity, he didn't mean to say that gravity worked this way in the 1600s, but hadn't in 600, and won't again in 2600. He meant this as a timeless law.<br /><br />However, he meant it as a timeless law that <em>because he assumed conservative induction</em> to be the right principal to use in formulating scientific theories. As Kelly unwittingly did in making his complaint about my example. For, if revolutionary induction (<em>Time for a change!</em>) is the right principle, then the fact that my law of gravitation was falsified today is no reason at all to think it has been falsified for all time, just like the fact that "Mitt Romney is president of the United States" is a false theory today says nothing about whether it will also be a false theory in six months. If revolutionary induction is based on an accurate view of the world, then the fact my theory was falsified today gives me great hope that it will <em>become true</em> tomorrow: today, it can be shown that masses attract each other with an inverse square law, while my theory says the attraction follows in inverse cube law. If tomorrow, the laws of physics all change, and gravity, in fact, obeys an inverse cube law, then my theory <em>becomes</em> true in just the same way "Mitt&nbsp; Romney is president of the US" becomes true if he is elected, in fact, in the only way empirical theories are ever true: <em>it will correctly describe reality</em>. So what, it doesn't do so today? From tomorrow on, it will!<br /><br />And what leads all of us to reject my new theory of gravity based on revolutionary induction, and theories like "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grue_and_bleen">grue and bleen</a>," as being valid scientific theories, is that we all, even Popperians, quite sensibly employ conservative induction in confronting the world.<br /><br />SYNOPSIS OF THE ARGUMENT:<br />1) A theory being falsified once only means it is falsified for all time <em>if it is a time-independent theory</em>.<br />2) But scientific laws are time-independent theories <em>only if we assume the principle of conservative induction</em>.<br />3) QED: Kelly unwittingly assumes conservative induction in his complaint above.</div>
