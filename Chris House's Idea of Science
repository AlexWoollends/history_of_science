<h3 class="post-title entry-title">Chris House's Idea of Science</h3>
<p>I mentioned Chris House's model of science in <a href="http://gene-callahan.blogspot.com/2014/01/who-cares-what-philosophers-of-science.html">a previous post</a>. But now I want to comment on a different aspect of its oddity. (And my goal here is not to pick on House, but on the view of science he has presented, because I think it is too common.) If you recall, House's model is this:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">The scientific method goes something like this:&nbsp;</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">Observation<br />Formation of hypotheses<br />Testing/evaluation<br />Repeat&nbsp;</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">If you can follow these steps then anything (even economics! even macroeconomics!) can be studied scientifically. &nbsp;When economics is at its best it truly is a science.&nbsp;</blockquote>
<div>The aspect I wish to point out in this post is that ever achieving any success at explaining anything plays no part, for House, on whether any endeavor is scientific.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Want to do "scientific" astrology?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Observe that the planets, moon, and sun move around in the sky relative to the "fixed stars."</li>
<li>Form an hypothesis: "When the moon is in the seventh house / And Jupiter aligns with Mars / Then peace will guide the planets / And love will steers the stars."</li>
<li>Test the above.</li>
<li>Form new hypothesis: "When the moon is in the second house / And Saturn aligns with Venus / Then war will guide the planets / And hate will steer the stars."</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><br />Obviously, one can go on like this forever, and according to House, what one is doing "truly is a science."</p>
<p>Similarly, macroeconomics should not be judged on whether it ever achieves any major successes. So long as it keeps following the above steps, it is a science.</p>
<p>This strikes me as idolatry of method over results.</p>
