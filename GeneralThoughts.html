    <h4>Pop history of science is often pretty terrible</h4>
    
    <p>
    <a href="http://thonyc.wordpress.com/2014/02/20/why-newtons-apple-is-not-a-good-story/">An actual historian</a> 
    looks at a pop "history" of science column and discovers it
    is about as accurate as an explanation of evolution that says, 
    "And one day a fish grew legs and walked up onto the land." 
    And Christie even missed a problem with the pop history account,
    in which Potter wrote "...how the young Newton, sent 
    home from school at Cambridge to avoid the plague of 1665,
    was sitting under a tree one day, saw an apple fall to the ground,
    and, in a flash of insight, came to understand the workings of gravity." 
    Christie notes that "the flash of insight" part is absurd, and 
    it took Newton another twenty years to put his thoughts in publishable form.
    But the problem Christie misses is the idea that Newton <em>ever</em>
    "came to understand the workings of gravity": he did not. He devised a 
    formula describing how objects under the influence of gravity would behave.
    But he had no model or theory of how gravity was producing
    this behavior, a fact which he readily admitted himself.
