<div dir="ltr"><a href="http://thonyc.wordpress.com/2014/02/20/why-newtons-apple-is-not-a-good-story/">An actual historian</a> looks at a pop "history" of science column and discovers it is about as accurate as an explanation of evolution that says, "And one day a fish grew legs and walked up onto the land."<br /><br />And Christie even missed a problem with the pop history account, in which Potter wrote: "...how the young Newton, sent home from school at Cambridge to avoid the plague of 1665, was sitting under a tree one day, saw an apple fall to the ground, and, in a flash of insight, came to understand the workings of gravity."<br /><br />Christie notes that "the flash of insight" part is absurd, and it took Newton another twenty years to put his thoughts in publishable form.<br /><br />But the problem Christie misses is the idea that Newton <em>ever</em> "came to understand the workings of gravity": he did not. He devised a formula describing how objects under the influence of gravity would behave. But he had no model or theory of how gravity was producing this behavior, a fact which he readily admitted himself.</div>
