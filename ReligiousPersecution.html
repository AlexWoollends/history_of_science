        <h3>Religious Persecution</h3>
        <h4>
            The Myth of Religion versus Science
        </h4>
        <p>
        
        I've been listening to a series of lectures by Professor Frederik Gregory.
        One of the interesting points he makes,
        a number of times during the lectures,
        is that research by historians of science has shown that the idea of
        a long-standing conflict between religion and science is something that
        has been read back into the past by modern intellectuals.
        Of course,
        there were incidents where some particular scientist ran
        afoul of some particular religious body (like Galileo).
        But, basically,
        until the mid-19th century,
        just about no scientists or religious people understood
        the two to be at conflict in some fundamental way.
        Most scientists talked of how their findings "showed the glory of God"
        -- and for the most part,
        this was not just for show,
        as most of them were genuinely devout.
        (Newton, for instance,
        spent more of his life on Bible studies than he did on physics or mathematics.)
        <br>
        
        <br>
        Furthermore, Gregory notes,
        the change in this view did not originate with science,
        but with the political radicals of the mid-19th century,
        who persuaded the younger scientists of the time that to be
        "progressive" one ought to be materialistic and atheistic.
        It was only then that the exact same sort of findings that,
        a generation before,
        would have displayed the glory of God, now were seen as indicating his non-existence!

        <h4>
        The Scores of Scientists Who Suffered Severely at 
        the Hands of the Church for Their Theories Include?
        </h4>
        
        <p>
        Over in the comments at Bob Murphy's blog,
        <a href="http://consultingbyrpm.com/blog/2013/08/interesting-narrative-on-the-heliocentric-theory-vs.-the-                                  church.html#comment-72131">George Selgin writes</a>:
            
        <br>
        
        <br>
        
        "That many of the most illustrious members of this tiny group
        [of scientific thinkers] suffered severely at the hands of
        religious persecutors is (or ought to be) notorious."
        <br>
        
        <br>
        I do not mean to pick on George,
        whom I regard as a very bright man,
        but here he is expressing a bit of "folk history"
        that I just don't see has much basis in fact.
        My interest is really about why this idea continues to circulate.
        
        <br>
        
        <br>
        One of the first things our history of science lecturer at King&rsquo;s College,
        John Milton, told us was that on the vast majority of scientific topics,
        the church simply <em>did not care</em>.
        So when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Buridan">Buridan</a>
        and&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oresme">Oresme</a>
        challenged Aristotelian mechanics: the church just did not care at all,
        one way or the other.
        <br>
        <br>
        Secondly,
        on the very few topics it <em>did</em> care about,
        it was always prepared to regard scripture as figurative,
        <em>if</em> the literal interpretation could be proven false.
        (So,
        since everyone knew the earth was round,
        the church had done this with the biblical passage mentioning its "four corners":
        this was just figurative speech.)
        Thus, with Galileo, church astronomers examined his
        evidence and found it wanting.
        (Which it was, frankly: for instance,
        he thought the tides were caused by the earth&rsquo;s
        rotation throwing the seas around, and that they had a 24-hour cycle.
        And Brahe's heliocentric theory accounted for the phases of Venus.
        Of course, Galileo was right,
        but he hadn't <em>proved</em> his case.)
        Thus they asked him to present heliocentrism as an hypothesis.
        He agreed, but then reneged,
        in a book in which he called the current Pope a simpleton.
        At that point he was subject to a fairly mild house arrest.
        (I think that was a mistake,
        but it is good to be clear on just what transpired.)
        <br>
        <br>
        Giordano Bruno was burned at the stake,
        but for heretical religious views,
        not for his scientific ideas, and he was not an important
        figure in the Scientific Revolution anyway.
        (Again, I am <em>not</em> in favor of death for religious heresy,
        but it has nothing to do with persecuting scientists.)
        <br>
        
        <br>
        Aside from those two,
        what important figures in the Scientific Revolution
        "suffered severely" at the hands of a Catholic
        or Protestant church for their views? Copernicus? No,
        the church never bothered him at all.
        Kepler? No, he suffered some by being in the
        midst of the religious warfare of the Reformation,
        but no one hindered his scientific work.
        Descartes? Nothing.
        Newton? Zilch.
        Boyle? Niente di niente.
        Hooke? Nada.
        Malebranche? Well,
        he was actually a priest,
        but he did have one work placed on the index of forbidden books.
        Huyghens? Died peacefully in his bed,
        never molested by any church.
        Halley? No.
        Leibniz? No persecution I know of.
        <br>
        <br>
        And yet,
        the idea still floats around that <em>many</em>
        of the leaders of the Scientific Revolution
        "suffered severely" at the hands of the church.
        This ought to be notorious.

        <p>    
            THE STORY OF GALILEO is one of the
            foundational myths of the modern, scientific
            age. As schoolchildren, we learn
            that he discovered the true nature of the
            solar system by heeding the plain evidence
            of the senses, eschewing dogma
            and metaphysical speculation. But when
            Galileo published his findings, the
            Catholic Church, in the guise of the
            Inquisition, demanded he recant his
            heretical notions. The Inquisition imprisoned
            and tortured him. To save his life,
            Galileo recanted. As he did so, however,
            he heroically muttered “And yet it [the
            earth] moves.”
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Recent scholarship on Galileo has
            revealed that almost every element of
            the myth is either entirely fictitious or is
            a distorted view of what really happened.
            Two recently published books,
            Galileo in Rome and Galileo’s Mistake,
            each draw attention to the many ways
            the myth varies from the historical facts.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            For example, the evidence available
            to astronomers in the early 17th century
            did not support Galileo’s model of the
            solar system. Some of Galileo’s key
            arguments for a heliocentric solar
            system today are regarded as wildly
            erroneous. A colleague of Galileo’s,
            Johannes Kepler, had developed a heliocentric
            model of planetary motion that
            fit the facts far better than Galileo’s
            theory did, as did Tycho Brahe’s geocentric
            model.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The Catholic Church was not committed
            to a literal interpretation of the Bible
            and had not been since at least the time
            of Augustine, over a thousand years
            before Galileo. Church scholars eagerly
            employed telescopes to observe the
            heavens. They carefully examined the
            evidence Galileo presented for his model
            but found it unconvincing. The prejudice
            in favor of a geocentric solar system,
            while supported by certain Biblical passages,
            was based mainly on Aristotelian
            physics. Galileo was never tortured, and
            almost certainly never uttered those
            famous words before the Inquisition.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The Galileo myth has been constructed
            in order to portray science as
            the champion of reason and commonsense
            attention to “the plain facts,”
            doing battle with the dark forces of dogmatism,
            represented by religion. However,
            as these two books demonstrate,
            the purveyors of this myth themselves
            have ignored the plain facts of history in
            creating it.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Far from relying on the direct evidence
            of the senses to make his case,
            Galileo had to contend that our senses
            frequently deceive us. Aristotelian
            physics, after all, was very much a science
            of direct observation. Our senses
            plainly tell us that the earth stands still
            and the sun moves. As philosopher Paul
            Feyerabend notes in Against Method,
            “seen from the point of view of these
            ‘facts,’ the idea of the motion of the
            earth is outlandish, absurd, and obviously
            false…” He quotes Galileo himself
            as asserting: “[Copernicus] resolutely
            continued to affirm what sensible experience
            seemed to contradict.”
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Proponents of the Galileo myth frequently
            mock his critics for questioning
            the veracity of the celestial images presented
            by the telescope, but this is unjustified.
            For one thing, the primary evidence
            we have for the existence of skeptics who
            simply refused to look through a telescope
            comes from Galileo himself. But, as
            Galileo’s Mistake notes, “recent scholarship
            suggests that his ‘opponents’ were
            frequently straw men concocted as part
            of Galileo’s polemical style.”
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Furthermore, in the early 17th century,
            telescopes were both quite new
            and quite primitive. Given the lack of
            experience looking through telescopes,
            coupled with their poor quality, it was
            often quite difficult, even for those sincerely
            open-minded, to make out just
            what they were seeing. And the telescope
            sometimes produced what were clearly
            optical illusions: how could one say with
            certainty that the moons of Jupiter or
            sunspots were not also illusions?
        </p>
        
        <p>
            But, supporters of the Galileo myth
            might contend, given that the telescope
            had yielded a startling extension of
            vision for well-known objects on the
            earth, wasn’t it obvious that it worked
            similarly for celestial objects? Such an
            argument ignores the essence of the
            debate in which Galileo was engaged.
            Aristotelian physics held that celestial
            entities were of an entirely different
            nature from terrestrial ones: simple
            observation seemed to affirm this, since
            terrestrial objects fall to the earth while
            celestial ones remain in the heavens.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Galileo, however, affirmed that the
            physics of the earth applied equally to
            the heavens. To argue that the success
            of telescopes with terrestrial objects
            proved that it worked well for extraterrestrial
            ones is to beg the primary question
            under debate. One would have had
            already to conclude that the physics of
            the heavens were identical to the
            physics of the earth before one could
            use the telescope’s earthly success to
            demonstrate its celestial efficacy.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The idea of Galileo as a pure empiricist
            is also contradicted by other facts.
            Galileo in Rome notes that one of the
            major pieces of evidence Galileo
            advanced for the Copernican system
            was the existence of tides, contending
            that they were caused by the motion of
            the earth.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            That is quite different from our current
            understanding, which is that tides arise
            from the gravitational influence of the
            moon. But what is really surprising about
            Galileo’s hypothesis is that he had not
            determined the period of the tides before
            advancing his theory! His hypothesis
            depended on a 24-hour tidal cycle, while
            in fact their cycle is 12 hours. When he
            learned that sailors in the Mediterranean
            reported that both high and low tides
            occurred twice a day, he dismissed the
            discrepancy as resulting from local variations
            in the ocean bottom.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Galileo also ignored Kepler’s suggestion
            that the planets orbit the sun in elliptical
            paths, rather than the circular ones
            Galileo proposed. Kepler’s model fit the
            data better than Galileo’s, yet Kepler’s
            letters to Galileo suggesting elliptical
            orbits never elicited a response.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Perhaps the primary conflict between
            Galileo and his early supporter Pope
            Urban VIII was whether astronomical
            theories were merely models or were, in
            some sense, the truth about the world.
            Urban had little problem with Copernicanism
            being presented as a model that
            enabled better predictions about planetary
            motion. But to contend that a model
            was “the truth,” in Urban’s view, was to
            “constrain God with necessity,” falsifying
            the true nature of His creation, which surpassed
            any schemes devised by mortals.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Galileo paid lip service to Urban’s
            view, hoping to stave off prosecution.
            But it was obvious that he thought
            Copernicanism was the real truth about
            the solar system. Today, as pointed out
            by Alfred North Whitehead in Science
            and the Modern World, science has
            come down on the side of Urban:
            “Galileo said that the earth moves and
            that the sun is fixed; the Inquisition said
            that the earth is fixed and the sun moves;
            and Newtonian astronomers… said that
            both the sun and the earth move. But
            now we say that any one of these three
            statements is equally true, provided that
            you have fixed your sense of ‘rest’ and
            ‘motion’ in the way required … ”
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Although the two books reviewed
            here express broadly similar views
            about Galileo’s relationship with the
            Church, Galileo in Rome is by far the
            more successful effort. It does not
            attempt to be more than a straightforward
            history of the events in question,
            but it does that job most ably, deftly
            employing the unifying device of
            Galileo’s six trips to Rome. The authors
            examine the changing context of each
            trip, thereby portraying the transformation
            of the relationship between Galileo
            and the Church. Shea, a professor of the
            history of science, and Artigas, who
            holds doctorates in both philosophy and
            physics, are content to let the reader
            reach his own conclusions.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            On the other hand, Galileo’s Mistake
            strives to be much more than just history,
            but it overreaches. Rowland combines
            history, travelogue, Socratic dialogue,
            philosophy of science, and
            contemporary social commentary. As a
            result, the book lacks focus, and contains
            many questionable extrapolations
            as well as outright mistakes.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            For example, Rowland says that the
            Copenhagen interpretation of quantum
            mechanics holds that consciousness is
            necessary for a subatomic particle to
            move from potential to actual existence.
            On the contrary, it is agnostic on this
            point, essentially advising physicists to
            ignore the philosophical overtones of
            their work. Rowland also describes
            “equants,” an essential term in Kepler’s
            model of the solar system, incorrectly.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The dialogues he intersperses
            throughout the book, purportedly
            involving himself, his atheistic friend
            Berkowitz, and a Catholic nun and
            scholar, Sister Maria Celeste, often seem
            contrived. For example, Rowland quotes
            at length from what is described as a
            scholarly work on Aristotle that Sister
            Maria has been working on for years.
            But the work “quoted” reads more like
            an encyclopedia entry on the philosopher
            than the product of decades of
            scholarship. It is laudable that Rowland
            introduces modern readers to the fundamentals
            of Aristotle’s thought. But why
            choose such a transparent device?

            The title of Rowland’s book comes
            from his contention that Galileo made a
            crucial error in believing that “nature is its
            own interpreter.” It is a promising notion,
            but Rowland lacks the philosophical
            ammunition to make a convincing case
            for it. Nevertheless, Galileo’s Mistake is
            still worth reading, with its broader, albeit
            flawed, reach complementing the
            approach of Galileo in Rome.

            Neither book suggests that its revisions
            of the Galileo myth should change
            the reader’s opinion of the behavior of
            the Catholic Church toward Galileo. The
            Church would have been within its
            rights to expel him if he had not
            recanted, but it wronged him by imprisoning
            him. Quite aside from this moral
            lapse, as a strategic move the prosecution
            was flawed. The Church turned
            Galileo into a hero, giving its enemies a
            tale they could retell for centuries in
            their war against religion.

            Nor does the more accurate history
            remove Galileo from the ranks of great
            scientists. With Galileo, science was
            making a major advance in much the
            same way it always does, through an
            inspired vision on the part of a scientist
            dissatisfied with the current state of
            theory. The stubbornness and egocentricity
            that Galileo displayed are often
            companions of the ability to make such
            a leap. Without such traits, it is difficult
            to sustain one’s views in the face of
            harsh criticism from the scientific establishment.
            But in replacing the Galileo
            myth with a more accurate history, we
            also see that science advances, much
            like religion, not by a simple-minded
            adherence to “the facts,” but through a
            leap of faith.
