        "When it comes to narratives, the brain seems to be the last province 
        of the theoretician-charlatan. Add neurosomething to a field, and suddenly 
        it rises in respectability and becomes more convincing as people now have 
        the illusion of a strong causal link..." -- Nassim Nicholas Taleb,
        <em>Antifragile</em>, p. 351
