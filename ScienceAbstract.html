    <h3>
        Science Is an Abstract World
    </h3>
    
    <h4>
        History, Queen of the Sciences
    </h4>
    
    <p>
    The late Sudha Shenoy once said to me, "They are
    approaching this theoretically, but the real world
    is historical, not theoretical." 
    </p>

    <p>
    I've thought about that remark a lot since then,
    and I think I have an idea what Sudha was saying.
    All of special sciences abstract as part of their
    essential nature: they are constituted by the style of
    abstraction in which they engage. If physics stopped
    looking at the world only in terms of forces and motions,
    and began, say, taking emotions and plans into 
    account, it would cease being physics.
    </p>

    <p>
    But history is only abstract accidentally: the historian
    and her readers are human beings, and no one has 
    time to read or write everything that happened. Nevertheless,
    as details are added and abstractness reduced, the work 
    becomes more, not less, historical. So history comes closer
    to the real world than any theoretical science can.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    An interesting corollary here is that, far
    from history being a sad stepchild of the "real,"
    experimental sciences, that would adopt their methods 
    if only it could, in fact, the experimental sciences are
    utterly dependent upon history. (This was noted by Collingwood decades ago.)
    </p>

    <p>
    The idea of an experiment itself is an historical achievement
    on the part of a historical group of people. There is no general
    experiment to see if something counts as a genuine experiment, for how
    would we know if that "experiment-testing" experiment was itself
    a genuine experiment? No, it is through an exercise in historical
    understanding that scientists determine if something counts as
    an experiment, as they consult the history of successful and of
    failed experiments in their discipline, and see how the one in
    question appears in light of that record. And it is through
    their historical understanding of a series of such experiments
    done in the past that scientists judge that a theory
    is discredited, or worth testing further, or so well-confirmed
    that there is no sense bothering to check it further (at present).
    </p>

    <p>
    The experimental sciences are dependent on history.
    </p>

    <p>
    Not experimental tests for what counts as an experiment.
