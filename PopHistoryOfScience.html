          <h4>How Bad Is Pop History of Science?</h4>
      
          <p>
          Renaissance Mathematicus gives 
          <a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2012/06/02/scientific-american-craps-out/">an example here</a>. 
          The author of the piece critiqued -- which was
          published by <em>Scientific American!</em>
          -- puts forward nonsense like "Copernicus's system did not explain 
          retrograde motion of the planets" -- when, in fact, the 
          major advance of Copernicus's system was its natural explanation
          of retrograde motion! -- and that Galileo "discovered that Venus was a planet and not a star" 
          -- something the ancient Greeks knew quite well. I studied the history
          of science for a year at King's College in London. 
          Pretty much the first thing our lecturer told us was that pop
          history of science was complete nonsense. And note: 
          although sometimes the junk pop history of science involves
          religious issues, nothing in the <em>Scientific American</em>
          piece has anything to do with such matters. It just seems that, 
          concerning the history of science, lots of people who have no
          idea what they are talking about want to publish on the topic.
