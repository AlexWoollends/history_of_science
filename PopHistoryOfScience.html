<h4 class="post-title entry-title">How Bad Is Pop History of Science?</h4>

<div dir="ltr">Renaissance Mathematicus gives <a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2012/06/02/scientific-american-craps-out/">an example here</a>.<br /><br />The author of the piece critiqued -- which was published by <em>Scientific American</em>! -- puts forward nonsense like "Copernicus's system did not explain retrograde motion of the planets" -- when, in fact, the major advance of Copernicus's system was its natural explanation of retrograde motion! -- and that Galileo "discovered that Venus was a planet and not a star" -- something the ancient Greeks knew quite well.<br /><br />I studied the history of science for a year at King's College in London. Pretty much the first thing our lecturer told us was that pop history of science was complete nonsense.<br /><br />And note: although sometimes the junk pop history of science involves religious issues, nothing in the <em>Scientific American</em> piece has anything to do with such matters. It just seems that, concerning the history of science, lots of people who have no idea what they are talking about want to publish on the topic.</div>
