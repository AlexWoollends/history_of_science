          <h4>How Bad Is Pop History of Science?</h4>
      
          <p>
          Renaissance Mathematicus gives 
          <a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2012/06/02/scientific-american-craps-out/">an example here</a>. 
          The author of the piece critiqued -- which was
          published by <em>Scientific American!</em>
          -- puts forward nonsense like "Copernicus's system did not explain 
          retrograde motion of the planets" -- when, in fact, the 
          major advance of Copernicus's system was its natural explanation
          of retrograde motion! -- and that Galileo "discovered that Venus was a planet and not a star" 
          -- something the ancient Greeks knew quite well. I studied the history
          of science for a year at King's College in London. 
          Pretty much the first thing our lecturer told us was that pop
          history of science was complete nonsense. And note: 
          although sometimes the junk pop history of science involves
          religious issues, nothing in the <em>Scientific American</em>
          piece has anything to do with such matters. It just seems that, 
          concerning the history of science, lots of people who have no
          idea what they are talking about want to publish on the topic.

          <h4>Pop history of science is often pretty terrible</h4>

          <a href="http://thonyc.wordpress.com/2014/02/20/why-newtons-apple-is-not-a-good-story/">
          An actual historian</a> 
          looks at a pop "history" of science column and discovers it
          is about as accurate as an explanation of evolution that says, 
          "And one day a fish grew legs and walked up onto the land." 
          And Christie even missed a problem with the pop history account,
          in which Potter wrote "...how the young Newton, sent 
          home from school at Cambridge to avoid the plague of 1665,
          was sitting under a tree one day, saw an apple fall to the ground,
          and, in a flash of insight, came to understand the workings of gravity." 
          Christie notes that "the flash of insight" part is absurd, and 
          it took Newton another twenty years to put his thoughts in publishable form.
          But the problem Christie misses is the idea that Newton <em>ever</em>
          "came to understand the workings of gravity": he did not. He devised a 
          formula describing how objects under the influence of gravity would behave.
          But he had no model or theory of how gravity was producing
          this behavior, a fact which he readily admitted himself.
